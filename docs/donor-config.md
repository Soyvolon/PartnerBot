# Donator Only Setup Options

> All Donator Only Setup Options require you to be a donator. Please see our [Donation Page](https://www.patreon.com/cessumdevelopment?fan_landing=true) for more information.

## Message Links

Want to add some custom links in your advertisement? From extra banner links to website links, the Message Links setup option is automatically applied to your Partner Message setup. With one link per Donor Rank you have, for a max of three links, you can add these directly to your Partner Message!

## Custom Embeds

Our largest donor feature: Custom Embeds. Being able to add custom embeds with fields to segment your data, and adding a custom banner per embed, and setting their color allows for a variety of setup configurations.

Banners are unlocked at Triple Partners and allow you to use a single embed. At Quadruple Partners your limit is upped to four.

If you are using an embed, you don't need a Partner Message for your setup to be toggled. However, this is not recommended, as if you lose the banner permissions your bot will not be sending any sort of message to other servers.

## Vanity Invite

!> Using a vanity invite requires you have a vanity invite for your server from Discord. We cannot give you vanity invites.

Want to use your servers Vanity Invite with Partner Bot? As a Double Partner or higher you can!
