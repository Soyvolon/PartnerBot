# Optional Setup Options
## Partner Banner

!> The following file extensions are supported for a banner: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`

The Partner Banner option can be used to add a flavorful image to your advertisement! You can either upload an image during the prompt or provide a link to an image that is saved online.

When uploading an image, make sure not to delete the image from Discord after you uploaded it, or your banner will not work!

When using an image link, make sure the link end in one of the supported file extensions. An example would be `http://www.apimages.com/Images/Ap_Creative_Stock_Header.jpg`. The link ends in `.jpg`, so its a good link to use.

## Embed Color

A smaller customization option, but it can still add plenty of color to your advertisement! Using the color option from the setup menu will allow you to change the color of the details embed that is sent with every partner message!

You can enter either your color two ways: A hex code (`#E91E63`) or an RGB color value (`233, 30, 99`). A great way to pick your color is with a [color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker).

## Partner Tags

An integral part of getting advertisement's that fit with the theme of your server! Add up to ten, all lowercase and no spaces, tags to your server to match with other servers of similar taste!

Good tag examples: `csharp`, `gaming`, `minecraft`, `bot-support`
