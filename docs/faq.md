# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does Partner Bot work?
Partner Bot works by automatically partnering your server with another server ever hour. The method by which Partner Bot shares advertisements is simple, for every advertisement your server receives, you have sent an advertisement. For example, server A gets server B's advertisement, therefore server B gets server A's advertisement.

## How do I set up Partner Bot?
Partner Bot can be setup by running `pb!setup #channel your advertisement goes here` on your server, or by using the interactive setup and just running the command `pb!setup` on your server.

## Why haven’t I gotten any members from Partner Bot?
!> We do not guarantee nor promise members. We only guarantee that your server will gain more publicity as Partner Bot continues to expand. Members will join your server if they choose to.

## How do I report a server that breaks the Partner Bot Terms of Service?
You can send an image of the offending server in our `#reports` channel, along with using copy and paste to place the ID that is sent after the message. The ID can be found in the grey box that is sent after every partner message you receive.

## Why am I banned from Partner Bot?
If your server has been found violating the Discord TOS or Partner Bot's TOS you will find your server banned from using the Partner Bot service. Partner Bot's TOS can be found in `#partner-bot-tos` while the Discord TOS can be found [here](https://discord.com/terms)

## How do I get unbanned from Partner Bot?
Please submit a request to a staff member in a support channel. You can open a support channel here: #request-support When asked, provide an invite to the staff member of the server in question, and they will direct your request to the proper staff members who will decide on a case by case basis.

## Why wont my animated banner work?
Partner Bot only supports image file formats for banners. If you are looking to make an animated banner, you need to use a `.gif` file, not a video file such as a `.mp4`.

## Where does Partner Bot create my invite?
Partner bot creates an invite in the same channel that you select for your partner channel.

## When do I need to mark my server as NSFW?
If your server is advertising anything NSFW in the advertisement message, such as an NSFW channel, it needs to be marked NSFW. Servers whose main premise revolves around NSFW content also needs to be marked as an NSFW server. You can designate your server as NSFW with `pb!setnsfw`.

## If my server is marked NSFW can I use NSFW content in my advertisement?
No. All advertisements must be Safe for Work.

## I don’t want to get advertisements that are advertising NSFW content, how do I disable those?
You can use the command `pb!receivensfw` to toggle receiving NSFW content on your server.

## How do I report a server that is advertising NSFW content and is not marked NSFW?
You can take a screenshot of the message and the embed at the bottom and send it to `#reports` where a staff member will see the report.

## I have reaction roles (or some other bot based verification) on my server to ensure people read the rules! Can I use Partner Bot?
Not with the reaction role verification. The recommended solution is to stop using a reaction to verify people read the rules, and instead use Discord's [Rules Screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ) feature.

Or, make the Partners channel public to anyone, even those who have not reacted to your rules.
